## Near-term priorities

### Silicon

- Stabilize ISA primitives for scalar, vector, and cube workflows.
- Keep the kernel-driver interface testable from day one.

### Virtualization

- Maintain a clean educational path from VMX concepts to runnable VMs.
- Expand device and networking examples that are easy to inspect.

### Compilers and frameworks

- Define minimal compiler passes with measurable outputs.
- Integrate with framework-level training workflows in small steps.

### Insights

- Add reproducible performance and cost analysis templates.
- Publish assumptions and formulas alongside each model.
