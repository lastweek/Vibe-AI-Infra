## Why this exists

Vibe AI Infra exists to make AI infrastructure understandable end-to-end. We build from the lowest levels of compute and virtualization through compilers and model frameworks, with a bias toward small, inspectable systems.

## Build philosophy

- Keep systems small enough to reason about.
- Publish implementation details, not only claims.
- Prefer reproducible benchmarks over narrative performance statements.
- Ship incrementally and keep operational complexity visible.

## What we are optimizing for

1. Fast learning loops for systems engineers.
2. Practical building blocks that can evolve into production.
3. A coherent stack where each layer clearly exposes the next bottleneck.

## How to contribute

If a project catches your interest, open an issue or start with a small PR in the related repository. Design notes and constraints matter as much as code.
