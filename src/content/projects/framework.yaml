    description: Production-grade distributed LLM training framework implementing tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism for training models from 125M to 671B parameters.
    status: TBD
    intro: |
      Nano Train is a production-grade distributed training framework built from scratch to train state-of-the-art language models like DeepSeek-R1 (671B Mixture-of-Experts). The framework implements comprehensive parallelism strategies similar to Megatron-LM with a cleaner, more modular architecture.

      ## Project Overview

      The framework addresses the challenge of training massive language models efficiently across distributed compute environments. It supports Mixture-of-Experts architectures and 3D parallelism (tensor, pipeline, data, sequence, and expert parallelism) designed to scale from 125M to 671B parameters on 1000+ GPUs.

      ## Current Status

      **Phase 0 Complete** - MVP training cycle working successfully:
      - Trained 125M parameter GPT-style model (33 minutes, 1000 steps)
      - Loss decreased from ~3.5 to 0.0000
      - Features: Basic transformer, training loop, optimizer, scheduler, data loader

      ## Architecture

      The framework follows a clean, modular architecture with distinct components:

      - **core/** - Infrastructure and foundational components
      - **models/** - Model architectures (GPT-style transformers)
      - **parallelism/** - Parallelism strategies (tensor, pipeline, data)
      - **training/** - Training infrastructure (loops, checkpoints, logging)
      - **data/** - Data loading and preprocessing

      ## Key Technologies

      - **PyTorch** - Industry standard with best distributed support
      - **BF16** - Primary precision for better numerical stability
      - **TensorBoard** - Comprehensive metrics tracking
      - **Cosine Annealing** - Learning rate scheduling with warmup
      - **AdamW** - Optimizer with weight decay

      ## Development Roadmap

      The project follows a 36-week phased roadmap:

      - **Phase 0** (Weeks 1-3): MVP ✅ Complete
      - **Phase 1** (Weeks 4-6): Production foundation with OmegaConf + Hydra
      - **Phase 2** (Weeks 7-10): Flash Attention, gradient checkpointing
      - **Phase 3-11**: Sequential implementation of parallelism strategies
      - **Final Goal**: 671B MoE model training at scale

      ## Key Innovations

      - **Automated Workflow**: Sync script for seamless local-to-cloud development
      - **Progressive Scaling**: From 125M MVP to 671B MoE models
      - **Clean Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
      - **Comprehensive Logging**: TensorBoard integration for metrics tracking
