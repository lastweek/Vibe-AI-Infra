  - name: Vibe KVM
    repo: vibe-kvm
    description: Educational implementation of the Linux KVM API for learning Intel VT-x virtualization at the hardware level.
    goals:
      - Complete VMX operation (VMXON, VMCS management, VM entry/exit)
      - EPT memory virtualization with 4-level paging
      - Virtio device framework (block and network devices)
      - SR-IOV device assignment for high-performance I/O
      - Comprehensive documentation and examples
    status: Done
  - name: Vibe VMM
    repo: vibe-vmm
    description: Minimal Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) in C with clean hypervisor abstraction for cross-platform VM execution.
    goals:
      - Multi-architecture support (x86_64 Linux KVM, x86_64/ARM64 macOS HVF)
      - Complete VM lifecycle management (create, run, destroy VMs)
      - Virtio device emulation (console, block, network)
      - SR-IOV VF passthrough via VFIO for device assignment
      - Comprehensive documentation and test kernels
    status: Done
  - name: Nano Sandbox
    repo: vibe-sandbox
    description: Educational OCI-compatible container runtime in C with pure-container and Firecracker-backed execution modes.
    goals:
      - Implement OCI spec parsing and lifecycle commands (`create`, `start`, `run`, `delete`, `state`)
      - Build Linux namespace, mount, cgroup v2, and process isolation paths
      - Persist structured runtime state and logs for debugging and observability
      - Maintain smoke, integration, and performance test workflows for end-to-end validation
      - Add Firecracker-based microVM execution for stronger workload sandboxing
    status: Done
  - name: Nano K8S Tutorial
    repo: nano-k8s-cluster
    description: Hands-on tutorial for building a minimal Kubernetes cluster from scratch using containerd and the K8s control plane APIs.
    goals:
      - Set up containerd as the container runtime
      - Configure and deploy the Kubernetes control plane components
      - Create and manage worker nodes
      - Deploy sample applications and validate cluster functionality
    status: WIP
